Given their logo, and grassroots approach, we wanted to go with an organic &#8220;storybook&#8221; style. The website is built around beautiful illustrations which capture the essence of the Milton Parc neighborhood and the organization’s variety of programs.

To ensure that the committee could continuously update the website, we custom-built a Wordpress theme for them that can be edited easily as needed." %}
