{% include port-pgph.html title="The client" offset="2" offset-mobile="2" color="dblue" content="The World University Services of Canada’s McGill Chapters sponsors 4 refugees every year. Sponsorship means help coming to Canada, support in paying tuition fees, and funding for books. Beyond that, it means providing the basic necessities some needs to thrive in a new country: winter clothes, food, social connections, and shelter. WUSC helps young people set up a new life, and invests in their long term growth." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The project" offset="3" offset-mobile="1" color="dorange" content="WUSC was aiming to raise their annual fee, solicited from students at McGill. We made a video to support their campaign to get students to vote for the fee raise. At the end of the day, more than 2000 students voted in favour of the campaign. We wanted to tell the story of a young refugee’s life through objects. Not just the basic necessities that set them up, but also the things that represented their growth and flourishing. The final message: WUSC helps build lives, and with two dollars, the audience can too." %}
