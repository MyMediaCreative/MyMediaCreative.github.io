We started our work by holding in-depth discovery sessions designed to facilitate reflection on the essence of the organization. We went on to write a mission/vision statement and a tone/voice document—which can guide NSILC in how they express themselves digitally.

On top of working on their written expressions of self, My Media modernized their existing logo and compiled several key visual brand guidelines into a brand book (alongside the content writing guidelines)." %}
