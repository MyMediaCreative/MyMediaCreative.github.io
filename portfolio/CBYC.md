{% include port-pgph.html title="The client" offset="2" offset-mobile="1" color="dblue" content="The Canadian Business Youth Council for Sustainable Development is a network of undergraduate business school students who want to push forward the sustainability movement in education. They do it through events, education, and resources for young people." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The video" offset="3" offset-mobile="2" color="dorange" content="The Youth Council wanted a “launch video” - so that they could come into the world with a bang! We delivered just that. This high intensity video shows the climate catastrophe in its most ugly form and exposes a key problem: young leaders are not being taught to address it. They are instead being taught to uphold the status quo. The video presents the Youth Council as a way to advocate for a different approach to education - so that we, as young leaders, can learn to disrupt rather than uphold." %}

{% include port-web.html title="The website" offset="4" color="lorange" content="The Youth Council wanted a website for two reasons. First, it would be the source of truth for engagement in their movement. It was the final step in their marketing funnel, and held the key to getting involved deeper. We delivered that for them. Second, they wanted to build a &#8220;Youth Guide&#8221; to sustainable business, a comprehensive look into the movement’s key ideas and leaders. We designed a system that made it easy for young people to navigate this wealth of ideas." %}
