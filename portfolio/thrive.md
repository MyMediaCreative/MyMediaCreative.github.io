{% include port-pgph.html title="The project" offset="4" offset-mobile="1" color="dblue" content="As they expand and pivot to a more digital model, Thrive needs to become truly “present” online. That required a brand. We worked with them through several discovery sessions to find a branding approach that truly fit them. From there, we built them a logo and other brand elements which speak to the empowering nature of Thrive’s community." %}
