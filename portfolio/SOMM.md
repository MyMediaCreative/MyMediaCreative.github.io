{% include port-pgph.html title="The client" offset="2" offset-mobile="2" color="dblue" content="The School of Music Montreal (SoMM) empowers young people through music. With an eye towards supporting those on the economic and social margins, SoMM provides free music lessons in classrooms across Montreal. They see music not just as a skill to develop, but also as a way that one can feel a sense of ownership and safety in their learning." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The project" offset="3" offset-mobile="1" color="dorange" content="SoMM wanted a video that spoke to the things that they do, and the impact they have. The goal was to use it to attract volunteers and build meaningful partnerships with schools. We went into several classrooms to observe the learning process, and interviewed volunteers about the impact that they are having. The result? A beautiful video that speaks to the joy of music in oneâ€™s life." %}

They were flexible, professional, open to ideas, and easy to communicate with. Their enthusiastic team is full of creative ideas, and their passion for our cause made our vision truly come to life. We were amazed by the quality of their content, and LOVED the promotional video they made for us at SoMM. <br> <br>
