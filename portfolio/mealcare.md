By partnering with university dining halls on campuses across Canada, MealCare has managed to prevent 25,000 meals worth of food from being wasted. Through partnerships with local food banks and soup kitchens, theyâ€™ve ensured that those meals go to people who need it." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The project" offset="3" offset-mobile="1" color="lorange" content="MealCare needed a video that they could use to build partnerships, raise funds, grow awareness, and attract volunteers. We built them something that spoke to their central mission, and illustrated the awesome work that their volunteers do every week." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="Testimonial" offset="2" color="navy" content="&#8220;MealCare was very lucky to work with the very capable team at My Media Creative. From the very beginning they understood our message and our vision, and catered to the needs of our non-profit. They were dedicated to getting a large variety of quality footage, even if that meant having to join us on multiple evening deliveries. They listened to our feedback on the video and the final product is perfect. We cannot be happier with the work they did, and would be lucky to work with them again in the future! Definitely recommend My Media Creative for your video and campaign needs!&#8221;" %}
