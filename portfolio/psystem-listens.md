{% include port-pgph.html title="The solution" offset="3" offset-mobile="1" color="dblue" content="Develop the “Psystem Listens” campaign—a mixed social media, paid advertising, content, and event campaign. We built a lot of the messaging around the founder’s brand as a spokesperson—building trust in their approach.

Next, we built several ads with the theme: &#8220;Pystem Listens&#8221;. This messaging emphasize Psystem’s uniquely empathetic and experience-rooted approach and opened the door to many collaborative podcasts and events. This helped build brand awareness while tapping into new audiences.

Psystem saw an 86% followership increase within three months of our plan’s implementation (114 follower increase)." %}
