{% include port-pgph.html title="The client" offset="2" offset-mobile="3" color="dorange" content="The McGill Policy Association works to bring students from across the academic spectrum into the policy making process. They firmly believe that everyone, from engineers to literature students, have a role to play in shaping public policy. They know that this interdisciplinary approach will yield more thoughtful and sustainable policy in the future. They champion these values through events, lectures, and hands-on learning programs." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The ask" offset="3" offset-mobile="1" color="dblue" content="The McGill Policy Association needed a brand that helped them level up. They wanted this visual identity to put them in league with McGill’s School of Public Policy (who they collaborate with on events quite often), and help them attract venerated guests to their event. In addition to building legitimacy, they wanted the brand to reflect their interdisciplinary approach." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The solution" offset="2" offset-mobile="2" color="dorange" content="We worked with the MPA team to develop something serious and focused. We benchmarked schools of public policy across the country, and pulled inspiration from a variety of recent activist movements and organizations. We built something that reflected a progressive policy approach which asks everyone to take part—while still paying homage to the institutions and processes that make good policy possible." %}
