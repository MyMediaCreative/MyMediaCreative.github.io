Our goal was to show why they are a vital community resource, and why peer-based support is such a vital part of the recovery process for so many young people with Eating Disorders. This video was viewed thousands of times, and caught the attention of reporters from CBC Daybreak - who went on to do a radio profile on the clinic." %}
